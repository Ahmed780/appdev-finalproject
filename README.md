DESCRIPTION: 

The graphical school system (GSS) is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) application which lets the users that sign onto it manage the various aspects of their account. In the given application, the user will be able to manage his and other users' accounts (depending on his access in the system). The information will be inputted by the user in the appropriate fields and will display in a specific way for other users based on their access level in the system. The user also could import and export user data using a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file. This lets the user create his own school system outside of the scope of the application and then import it for it to be displayed. The main idea of this system is for the user to easily be able to manage the administrative aspects of the school system. 

 
FUNCTIONALITY:  

The GSS is an easy-to-use GUI that the user can easily use and access. The GUI will present the user with several fields related to the client's, information such as first name, last name, student id, date of birth and program. The user then will have access to several controls, like add new course, student, and teacher. These features will use a CSV file to store information and delete and add depending on the function that is used. In the input boxes, the user will be able to input their information, and with the buttons will be able to manage the information easily. Each user in the GSS system will have different permissions depending on the type of user they are (Student, Teacher and Admin).  

 
FEATURES:   

The GSS system uses CSV files to store client information. After receiving this information, the user will have access to numerous functionalities to manipulate the information that they have, such as: 

Information input: This will allow the user to input client information such as their username and password to login to their account. This feature will use two textboxes for the user to input their data. This feature will also be using the CSV files to check if the user is registered. 

 
Client browsing: This function will be able to display a student's information by browsing through the CSV file. To navigate through the CSV file the client will need to input the student's ID. After inputting the student's id and clicking the display button it will show the student's first name, last name, program, and date of birth. This will also allow the student to monitor his grades and assignments, as well as the courses he is registered to. 

 

Client management: This function will allow the user to add, delete users from their class. After using this function, it will also delete their information from the CSV file if the user wants to delete other users. 

 
CSV file: This function will enable the user to manage CSV files with the information that the user desires. It will also allow importing and loading an existing file as well as exporting an existing school system to a CSV file. This will be useful to the user, as he will not need to enter all the data manually. 

 
 WHO IS THIS APPLICATION FOR? 

This application is intended for students and school staff who can easily manage their account based on their access in the school system. Students and school staff can update and view relevant information using the numerous functions in the GSS.
